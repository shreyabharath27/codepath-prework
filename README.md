New App Idea:
Recipe Roulette is a fun and interactive cooking app for
people who struggle with deciding what to eat or want to break
out of their usual meal routines. Users can input ingredients
they have on hand, dietary preferences, or time constraints,
and the app spins a "roulette wheel" to suggest a random
recipe that fits their criteria.

Key features:  
1. Input available ingredients, and the app generates recipes to reduce food waste.
2. A playful spin feature to randomly select a recipe, making meal planning more exciting.
3. Options for vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and other dietary needs.
4. Users can upload their own recipes for others to try.
